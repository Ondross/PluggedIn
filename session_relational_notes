student has many sessions
session has many students?
probably unnecessary

current session?  Put it in the students controller,  if months = range => season, also current year == year?
must work out this actual logic.

CONTROLLER:
for |student| in Students.All:
	if student == newstudent   (not the same entry though)
		for attribute in newstudent:
			if empty, replace with student.attribute
		delete student

create a new Session.  All the old ones will be remembered.

MODEL:
make Session model.  Year, Season, Student.first + Student.last


StudentsView:
for |Student|
	for Session.All
		if session.student == Student
			%= Session.year + Session.season

MAKE SESSION VIEW HIDDEN
